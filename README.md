# Office 2013 Updater
The main objective of this project was to provides a quick way to slipstream all published updates of Office, from 2007 to 2013 versions and for x86 or x64 platforms.

## Status
Although the splistream mecanism works, I aborted the development of this project as the Office setup was not able to apply all integrated updates.
As an example, all commented updates in the download source list are specific updated that are ignored during setup and so are proposed though Windows Update.

As it is not clear which updated are apply or not, this project is for now useless. The behavior of the Office setup explains the proff-of-concept state of the project.

## How to use
The POC is simple enough to be self-explanatory, all variables are set in the Main method.
